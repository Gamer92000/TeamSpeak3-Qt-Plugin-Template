## üìñ Description

This is a simple example plugin for TeamSpeak. It is meant to be used as a starting point for developing your own plugins. Using CMake, it can be compiled for all supported platforms.

## üìù License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## üìö Documentation

An outdated documentation for the TeamSpeak Client SDK can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/TeamSpeak-Systems/ts3client-pluginsdk/releases/tag/23) of the plugin SDK.

This plugin uses the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework. The Qt documentation can be found [here](https://doc.qt.io/).

## üì¶ Requirements

To compile this plugin (on Windows), you need the following software installed:

* [Qt =5.12.3](https://www.qt.io/download)
* [CMake >=3.10](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Visual Studio <=2019 (Toolset v140)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## üöÄ Usage

To create a new plugin based on this example, you can use the button `Use this template` on GitHub. This will create a new repository for you, which you can clone and modify.

### üë∂ First steps

First, you need to rename the plugin. To do this, you need to change the following files:

* `CMakeLists.txt`
* `src/definitions.hpp`
* `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
* `deploy/package.ini`

For Cmake, you also need to point it to the correct Qt installation. To do this, you need to change the following line in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```diff
-# list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "H:/Qt/5.12.3/msvc2017_64")
+list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "H:/Qt/5.12.3/msvc2017_64")
```

### üì¶ Before Updating

Before publishing a new version of your plugin, don't forget to update the version number of the plugin in the following files:

* `src/definitions.hpp`
* `deploy/package.ini`
