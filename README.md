## 📖 Description

This is a simple example plugin for TeamSpeak. It is meant to be used as a starting point for developing your own plugins. Using CMake, it can be compiled for all supported platforms.

## 📝 License

This project is licensed under the MIT License - see the [LICENSE](LICENSE) file for details.

## 📚 Documentation

An outdated documentation for the TeamSpeak Client SDK can be found in the [latest release](https://github.com/TeamSpeak-Systems/ts3client-pluginsdk/releases/tag/23) of the plugin SDK.

This plugin uses the [Qt](https://www.qt.io/) framework. The Qt documentation can be found [here](https://doc.qt.io/).

## 📦 Requirements

To compile this plugin (on Windows), you need the following software installed:

* [Qt =5.15.2](https://www.qt.io/download)
* [CMake >=3.10](https://cmake.org/download/)
* [Visual Studio <=2019 (Toolset v140)](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/downloads/)

## 🚀 Usage

To create a new plugin based on this example, you can use the button `Use this template` on GitHub. This will create a new repository for you, which you can clone and modify.

### 👶 First steps

First, you need to rename the plugin. To do this, you need to change the following files:

* `.github/workflows/deploy.yml`
* `deploy/package.ini`
* `src/config.cpp`
* `src/definitions.hpp`

When you want to compile locally you need to point CMake to the correct Qt installation. To do this, you need to change the following line in `CMakeLists.txt`:

```diff
-# list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "H:/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64")
+list(APPEND CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH "H:/Qt/5.15.2/msvc2019_64")
```

Furthermore, you need to set `plugin_name` to allow for CMake to work properly:

```diff
-project("<plugin_name>")
+project("example")
```

### 📦 Before Updating

Even the version numbering is handeled by the build script.
The version number is defined by the tag pushed to GitHub.
So there is nothing special you need to do 🎉.
